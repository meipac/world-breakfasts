**Marillen knödel** is one of my favorite dishes. It's also called "apricot dumplings". I discovered it in Austria where I went on a bicycle tour with my family in 2016. We had the chance to visit apricot orchards along the river Danube. Apricot is highly appreciated in this country and they even have a festival dedicated to this fruit in July, where you can drink apricot juice, eat apricot dumplings and buy apricot candies.
