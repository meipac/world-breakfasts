Optional, lift up one edge of the dough and genty pull to stretch it even more.
    4. Scrape and push the upper end of the dough to the middle. Do the same to the lower end, forming a wrinkle thin log. Starting at one end of the log, roll it into a circle and tuck the other end inside. Leave aside for 10 minutes before cooking. Meanwhile you can continue with the rest the balls.

**Roti canai is a typical Malaysian breakfast**. It's a kind of very thin crepe, fried in the pan. We eat it dipped in spicy sauce and sprinkled with sugar. This is so delicious! As you can imagine, I try to eat "Roti Canai" as often as I can when I go to Malaysia. It can usually be found on street food markets or stalls.

The most amazing thing about Roti Canai is how they fling it to make it paper thin. Here's a video that will show you how it's done:
