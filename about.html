	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Welcome to my food blog! My name is Meily and I'm a big traveller.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Paris, France. I'm fourteen and live with my parents and a little brother. My hobbies are volley-ball and violin. Being a Franco-Malaysian, I was 3 months old the first I travelled to Asia and have never stopped travelling since then.</p>

	<p>
		When I travel, I like to discover the culture of each country through its gastronomy. I take great pleasure in tasting new flavors, fruits or ingredients I didn't even know existed.
	    If you like to eat delicious food and try new recipes, this blog is for you! I promise to make you travel from the comfort of your home!</p>

	<p>Why only breakfast? 
		Because it's "the most important meal of the day" and each country has his own way of taking breakfast.
		For example, French families eat baguette and croissant with butter and jam, when British people prefer fried eggs, baked beans, bacon, mushrooms and pudding. 
		In the USA, you can easily find pancakes accompanied by marple syrup, which is delicious but very caloric!

	<p>Let's talk about breakfast and compare the culture of different countries. I hope you will appreciate this blog and enjoy its recipes!</p>
